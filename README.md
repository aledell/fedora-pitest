pitest has found several deeply-subtle bugs in my own code.  I have been using Fedora primarily since RedHat Linux 6.2, with experimental linux-primary as far back as 1995).

It seems to me that other Fedora fanatics should benefit from pitest at least as much as I have, and experiment with doing so as easily as: yum install pitest

I see some active work on a sonar plugin; I would like this repo to also support Fedorar-compatible sonar.
